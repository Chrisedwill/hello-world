This is a prusa i3 mk3 config file for TPU  settings using the standard 400um nozzle size.  A thin coat of PVA  is recommended. 
If TPU sticks to the build plate then use isopropyl to release.
The Live z was set to -0.5mm.   Note the work printer needs to run hotter at about 225C to print with good layer bonding. Maximum print speed has been set at 35 however  filament may jam requiring slower peak speed settings.
