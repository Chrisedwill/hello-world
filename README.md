This is a prusa i3 mk3 config file for TPU  settings using the standard 400um nozzle size.  A thin coat of PVa  is recommended. 
If TPU sticks to the build plate then use isopropyl to release.
The Live z was set to -0.5mm.   Note work printer needs additional 10-15C to work and may jam requiring slower peak speed.
